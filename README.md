<h1> ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK (PROJECT TWO) </h1>
As a developer, I want to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so people can play and have fun." Features: Simple User Interface: The game has easy-to-click buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. It looks clean and simple because of CSS styling. Game Logic: JavaScript runs the game by checking the player’s choice against a random computer choice and deciding who wins. It also keeps track of the scores and shows them on the screen. Immediate Feedback: After each round, the game shows what the player and computer picked and whether the player won, lost, or tied. It updates the scores right away. Testing: Debugging: I used the console log tool in the browser to find and fix errors in the JavaScript code, like spelling mistakes and missing symbols that messed up the game. Fixing File Links: A big problem was the game crashing because the JavaScript and CSS files weren’t linked right in the HTML. I deleted everything and started over twice before finding out it was just a linking error. Fixing the links made the game work properly. Checking Functionality: I tested every part of the game, making sure the buttons worked, the right winner was shown, and the scores updated. I played through a bunch of rounds to be sure everything was right. Tutor Help: My tutor, Patrick Rory, helped me a lot, showing me how to find bugs and reminding me to check things step by step. His help was really important in getting the game working.

Conclusion I encountered several issues that caused the game to malfunction. The main problems were numerous spelling errors in my JavaScript code, which prevented the game from properly registering player choices and updating the scores. Additionally, I had linking errors between my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which meant the scripts and styles were not loading as intended. This caused further complications, like buttons not working correctly and the game's layout appearing broken. To resolve these issues, I utilized the console log method in the browser's inspect tool, which allowed me to debug the JavaScript code line by line. This process helped me identify the specific lines where spelling mistakes were causing errors. My tutor, Patrick Rory, guided me through each step of troubleshooting, teaching me how to systematically check for errors and correct the links between the files. With his assistance, I was able to refine my code, fix the spelling mistakes, and ensure all files were correctly connected, ultimately getting my game to work as expected. In addition to the spelling errors and linking issues, I encountered several simple yet frustrating mistakes that added to my struggles. For instance, I missed a few semicolons and parentheses in my JavaScript code, which caused unexpected behavior and errors that were not immediately obvious. There were also syntax errors like missing curly braces that broke the flow of my functions. To fix these, I meticulously combed through each line of code, using console logs to pinpoint exactly where the code was failing. Patrick Rory’s guidance was invaluable during this process; he showed me how small mistakes could snowball into bigger issues, and he encouraged me to stay patient and methodical. Despite these efforts, the game kept crashing at the very end, and I mistakenly believed the entire code was corrupted. In my frustration, I ended up deleting the entire set of files and starting over twice, only to later discover that the root of the problem was a simple linking error between my JavaScript file and the HTML. This oversight cost me a lot of time and effort, but it was a valuable lesson in the importance of checking file paths and links early on in the troubleshooting process. Ultimately, with persistence and some help from my tutor, I managed to fix the linking issues, and the game finally ran smoothly as intended.
